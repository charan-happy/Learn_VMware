# AGE CALCULATOR USING TKINGTER

## objective :
    > We are creating an app in which the user can type in his date of birth and the app will calculate his name and print it.
## STEP 1 :
> We need to import the 3 libraries. They are 1.tkinter 2.datetime to work with dates and 3. PIL library which will help us to work with images

## STEP 2:
    > Create an window for our app
## step 3 :
    > create labels
## step 4: 
   > Adjustment of label values
## step 5 :
    > define function to get user inputs, called getinput() . Inside that, we create an object of the 'Person' class(which will be defined later) and pass the name and birth date to '_init_' method of the class.
    - Here we used predefined int() method to convert values into integer format. Then, we create a text area that will display the age of the user as output.
## step 6:
> create a button for the user to submit details
## step 7 :
> create age, _init_ methods
## step 8
> Adding image
## step 9 :
>Run code inside the mainloop() method
