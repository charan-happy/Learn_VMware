[interview questions](https://www.techwrix.com/top-50-vmware-interview-questions-and-answers-of-2023/)

[scenario based interview questions](https://interviewprep.org/vmware-engineer-interview-questions/)
# interview questions :

#1. What is VMKernel, and why is it important?

VMkernel is a virtualization interface between a Virtual Machine and the ESXi host, which stores VMs. It is responsible for allocating all available resources of the ESXi host to VMs such as memory, CPU, storage, etc. It’s also controlled special services such as vMotion, Fault tolerance, NFS, traffic management, and iSCSI. To access these services, the VMkernel port can be configured on the ESXi server using a standard or distributed vSwitch. Without VMkernel, hosted VMs cannot communicate with the ESXi server.

#2. What are the hypervisor and their types?

A hypervisor is a virtualization layer that enables multiple operating systems to share a single hardware host. Each operating system or VM is allocated physical resources such as memory, CPU, storage, etc., by the host. There are two types of hypervisors.

Hosted hypervisor (works as application i-e VMware Workstation)
Bare-metal (is virtualization software i-e VMvisor, Hyper-V which is installed directly onto the hardware and controls all physical resources).

#3. What is Virtualization?

The process of creating virtual versions of physical components, i.e., Servers, Storage Devices, Network Devices on a physical host, is called virtualization. Virtualization lets you run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine which is called ESXi host.

#4. What are the different types of virtualization?

There are 5 basic types of virtualization.

Server virtualization: consolidates the physical server, and multiple OS can be run on a single server.

Network Virtualization: Provides complete reproduction of physical network into a software-defined network.

Storage Virtualization: Provides an abstraction layer for physical storage resources to manage and optimize virtual deployment.
Application Virtualization: increased mobility of applications and allows migration of VMs from a host to another with minimal downtime.

Desktop Virtualization: virtualize desktop to reduce cost and increase service

VMware Fault Tolerance (FT) Interview Questions

#5. What is VMware FT?

FT stands for Fault Tolerance very prominent component of VMware vSphere. It provides continuous availability for VMs when an ESXi host fails. It supports up to 4 vCPUs and 64 GB memory. FT is very bandwidth-intensive, and 10GB NIC is recommended to configure it. It creates a complete copy of an entire VM such as storage, compute, and memory.

#6. How many vCPUs can be used for a VM in FT in VMware vSphere 7.0?

In VMware vSphere 7.0, there can be up to 8 vCPUs with the VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus license.

#7. What is the name of the technology used by VMware FT?

vLockstep technology is used by VMware FT

#8. What is Fault Tolerant Logging?

The communication between two ESXi hosts is called FT logging when FT is configured between them. The pre-requisition of configuring FT is to configure the VMKernel port.

#9. Will the FT work if the vCenter Server goes down?

vCenter Server is only required to enable Fault Tolerance on a VM. Once it is configured, vCenter is not required to be online for FT to work. FT failover between primary and secondary will occur even if the vCenter is down.

#10. What is the main difference between VMware HA and FT?

The main difference between VMware HA and FT is: HA is enabled per cluster, and VMware FT is enabled per VM. In HA, VMs will be re-started and powered-on on another host in case of a host failure, while in FT, there is no downtime because the second copy will be activated in case of host failure.

Virtual Networking Interview Questions

#11. What is virtual networking?

A network of VMs running on a physical server that is connected logically with each other is called virtual networking.

#12. What is vSS?

vSS stands for Virtual Standard Switch is responsible for the communication of VMs hosted on a single physical host. it works like a physical switch that automatically detects a VM which wants to communicate with another VM on the same physical server.

#13. What is vDS?

vDS stands for Virtual Distributed Switch acts as a single switch in a whole virtual environment and is responsible for providing central provisioning, administration, and monitoring of the virtual network.

#14. How many maximum standard ports per host are available?

4096 ports per host are available either in a standard switch or distributed switch.

#15. What are the main benefits of a distributed switch (vDS)?

vDS can provide:

The central administration for a virtual data center
Central provision, and
Monitoring

#16. What is the VMKernal adapter, and why is it used?

VMKernel adapter provides network connectivity to the ESXi host to handle network traffic for vMotion, IP Storage, NAS, Fault Tolerance, and vSAN. For each type of traffic, such as vMotion, vSAN, etc. separate VMKernal adapter should be created and configured.

#17. What is the main use of port groups in data center virtualization?

You can segregate the network traffic using port groups such as vMotion, FT, management traffic, etc.

#18. What are the three-port groups configured in ESXi networking?

Virtual Machine Port Group – Used for Virtual Machine Network
Service Console Port Group – Used for Service Console Communications
VMKernel Port Group – Used for VMotion, iSCSI, NFS Communications

#19. What is VLAN, and why use it in virtual networking?

A logical configuration on the switch port to segment the IP Traffic where each segment cannot communicate with other segments without proper rules is called VLAN. Every VLAN has a proper number called VLAN ID.

#20. What is VLAN Tagging?

The practice of inserting VLAN ID into a packet header to identify which VLAN packet belongs to is called VLAN tagging.

#21. What are the three network security policies/modes on vSwitch?

Promiscuous mode
MAC address change
Forged transmits

#22. What is the promiscuous mode on vSwitch?

Promiscuous mode is a security policy that can be defined at the virtual switch or portgroup level in vSphere ESX/ESXi. A virtual machine, Service Console, or VMkernel network interface in a portgroup that allows the use of promiscuous mode can see all network traffic traversing the virtual switch.

By default, a guest operating system’s virtual network adapter only receives frames that are meant for it. Placing the guest’s network adapter in promiscuous mode causes it to receive all frames passed on the virtual switch that is allowed under the VLAN policy for the associated portgroup. This can be useful for intrusion detection monitoring or if a sniffer needs to analyze all traffic on the network segment.

#23. What is MAC address changes network policy?

The security policy of a virtual switch includes a MAC address change option. This option affects the traffic that a virtual machine receives.

When the Mac address changes option is set to Accept, ESXi accepts requests to change the effective MAC address to a different address than the initial MAC address.

When the Mac address changes option is set to Reject, ESXi does not honor requests to change the effective MAC address to a different address than the initial MAC address. This setting protects the host against MAC impersonation.

#24. What is the Forged transmits network policy?

The Forged transmits option affects traffic that is transmitted from a virtual machine.

When the Forged transmits option is set to Accept, ESXi does not compare source and effective MAC addresses.

VMware vCenter Server Interview Questions

#25. What are the main components of vCenter Server architecture?

vCenter Server provides a centralized platform for management, operation, resource provisioning, and performance evaluation of virtual machines and hosts.

When you deploy the vCenter Server Appliance, vCenter Server, the vCenter Server components, and the authentication services are deployed on the same system.

The following components are included in the vCenter Server appliance deployments:

It is a disk image file format that contains the contents of an optical disk, such as a CD or DVD.
Usage in VMware:
In VMware, ISO files are often used to store the installation media for operating systems or software.
During VM creation or maintenance, an ISO can be mounted to a virtual CD/DVD drive to install or update software.
OVA (Open Virtualization Appliance):

Format:
OVA is a single-file distribution of the OVF format.
It is a package that contains all the files necessary for deploying a virtual appliance, including the OVF file, VMDK files, and other resources.
Usage in VMware:
OVA files simplify the deployment of virtual appliances by bundling all required files into a single archive.
Deploying an OVA involves importing it into a VMware environment, and it is often used for distributing pre-configured virtual appliances.
OVF (Open Virtualization Format):

Format:
OVF is a standard for packaging and distributing virtual appliances.
It is a set of files, including a descriptor file (OVF file), configuration files, and one or more virtual disk files (VMDK).
Usage in VMware:
OVF files provide a standardized way to describe the configuration and properties of a virtual machine or virtual appliance.
Deploying an OVF involves importing the individual files into a VMware environment, and it is used for interoperability across different virtualization platforms.
